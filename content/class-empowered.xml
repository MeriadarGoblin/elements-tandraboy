        <description>
            <p>The masked man takes one arrow to the chest. Then another. Despite the beating he is taking, he simply won't go down. Suddenly, he leaps towards his attacker and takes flight, leaving acrater in the ground where he stood. Once he grabs ahold of his opponent, he lifts them and throws them into a nearby wall. He picks up the bandit's bow and snaps it in half before turning to greet his adoring fans.</p>
            <p class="indent">Just when the goblins are about to leave, they see someone walking directly out of the burning village: an elf whose skin is wreathed in crimson flames. The last thing the goblins see is the inferno blooming from her hand.</p>
            <p class="indent">Within the blink of an eye, the tiefling speeds past theguards, into the tower, and makes their way through thedungeon. The prisoner barely has time to realize he's being saved before he's outside of the castle walls. The tiefling stops to catch their breath for just a moment before speeding right back in, faster than the eye can see.</p>
            <p class="indent">No matter where they may go, an empowered will always be trying to change the world. Sometimes it's for the better, other times... not so much.</p>
            <h4>With Great Power...</h4>
            <p>Unlike sorcerers, empowered beings have not been gifted mastery over magic. Instead, they have been given supernatural strength. They can punch with the weight of the world behind them, crush boulders, and are often capable of natural flight.</p>
            <p class="indent">There are times when an empowered's abilities might seem akin to magic, but this would be a misunderstanding. What arcane abilities they do have are built directly into their physiology. If an empowered can summon lightning from their fingertips, an autopsy would likely find significant mutations in the empowered's hands.</p>
            <h4>...Comes Great Responsibility</h4>
            <p>These powers grow and develop in ways that the empowered may not fully understand. Since no two empowered beings are exactly alike in their abilities, no one is well suited to guide them. Being innately different from the rest of their kin gives an empowered the opportunity to be a hero, but it can also lead to a life of villainy.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A empowered</h4>
            <p>The key to creating an empowered is figuring out their origin story. Where did you get your powers? Did an alien crystal fuse with you after crash landing on your planet? Has an extra-planar entity chosen you as their champion?</p>
            <p class="indent">The next important step is to determine how your empowered has responded to their abilities. An empowered can have almost any backstory or alignment depending on how they came to be who they are now. Have they had powers since birth? Did they discover them last week? Are they hiding their abilities, or reveling in them?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an empowered quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, and your next highest into Constitution. Second, choose the folk hero background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <description>While you are grappling a creature that is your size or smaller, you can expend a use of Strength Surge as an action to throw the creature in any direction. The creature moves a number of feet equal to 10 times your proficiency bonus. If the creature impacts an obstacle, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet that they were thrown. If the obstacle is another creature, this damage is shared between the two creatures equally. If the creature is in the air after being thrown, they begin to fall normally.</description>

            <p>This armor was built by a legendary artificer who gave their life to save the universe. The armor is red with golden trim, and a shining diamond is embedded in the chestplate.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dario built a sentient entity named Silas into this armor. Once Silas deems you worthy of the armor, you become proficient with it, and can use your Pure Strength and the Flight astounding power while wearing it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you are attuned to this armor, you can don and doff it instantly, as every piece of it shall fly to you and attach itself as needed so long as it is within 30 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, while you are attuned to this armor, you can cast <em>Eldritch Blast</em> from the armor's gauntlets using Constitution as your spellcasting ability and without using verbal components.</p>
            <h5>Sentience</h5>
            <p>Silas is neutral good, with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 13. They have hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">Silas can speak telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of the armor, and can speak, read, and understand Common.</p>
            <h5>Personality</h5>
            <p>Silas was built after Dario gave up on building weapons, opting to make creations that protect rather than kill. As such, Silas will happily advise and assist their wearer when needed, but only if your intentions are noble.</p>
